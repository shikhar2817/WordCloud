An Ethernet frame is preceded by a preamble and start frame delimiter 
(SFD), which are both part of the Ethernet packet at the physical layer. 
Each Ethernet frame starts with an Ethernet header, which contains destination 
and source MAC addresses as its first two fields. The middle section of the 
frame is payload data including any headers for other protocols (for example, 
Internet Protocol) carried in the frame. The frame ends with a frame 
check sequence (FCS), which is a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check used 
to detect any in-transit corruption of data.
The preamble consists of a 56-bit (seven-byte) pattern of alternating 1 
and 0 bits, allowing devices on the network to easily synchronize their 
receiver clocks, providing bit-level synchronization. It is followed by 
the SFD to provide byte-level synchronization and to mark a new incoming frame. For Ethernet variants transmitting serial bits instead of larger symbols, the (uncoded) on-the-wire bit pattern for the preamble together with the SFD portion of the frame is 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101011;[3]:sections 4.2.5 and 3.2.2 The bits are transmitted in order, from left to right.[3]:sections 4.2.5
The SFD is the eight-bit (one-byte) value that marks the end of the 
preamble, which is the first field of an Ethernet packet, and indicates 
the beginning of the Ethernet frame. The SFD is designed to break the 
bit pattern of the preamble and signal the start of the actual frame.
[3]:section 4.2.5 The SFD is immediately followed by the destination 
MAC address, which is the first field in an Ethernet frame. SFD is the 
binary sequence 10101011 (0xAB, decimal 171 in the Ethernet LSB first 
bit ordering).[3]:sections 3.2.2, 3.3 and 4.2.6
Physical layer transceiver circuitry (PHY for short) is required to 
connect the Ethernet MAC to the physical medium. The connection between 
a PHY and MAC is independent of the physical medium and uses a bus from 
the media independent interface family (MII, GMII, RGMII, SGMII, XGMII).
 Fast Ethernet transceiver chips utilize the MII bus, which is a four-bit
  (one nibble) wide bus, therefore the preamble is represented as 
  14 instances of 0xA, and the SFD is 0xA 0xB (as nibbles). Gigabit 
  Ethernet transceiver chips use the GMII bus, which is an eight-bit 
  wide interface, so the preamble sequence followed by the SFD would be 
  0xAA 0xAA 0xAA 0xAA 0xAA 0xAA 0xAA 0xAB (as bytes).
In the language of visual design, a tag cloud (or word cloud) is one 
kind of "weighted list", as commonly used on geographic maps to 
represent the relative size of cities in terms of relative typeface 
size. An early printed example of a weighted list of English keywords
 was the "subconscious files" in Douglas Coupland's Microserfs (1995). 
 A German appearance occurred in 1992.[4]
The specific visual form and common use of the term "tag cloud" rose to 
prominence in the first decade of the 21st century as a widespread feature 
of early Web 2.0 websites and blogs, used primarily to visualize the 
frequency distribution of keyword metadata that describe website 
content, and as a navigation aid.
The first tag clouds on a high-profile website were on the photo 
sharing site Flickr, created by Flickr co-founder and interaction 
designer Stewart Butterfield in 2004. That implementation was based 
on Jim Flanagan's Search Referral Zeitgeist,[5] a visualization of
Web site referrers. Tag clouds were also popularized around the 
same time by Del.icio.us and Technorati, among others.
Oversaturation of the tag cloud method and ambivalence about its 
utility as a web-navigation tool led to a noted decline of usage 
among these early adopters.[6] (Flickr would later "apologize" to 
the web-development community in their five-word acceptance speech 
for the 2006 "Best Practices" Webby Award, where they simply stated 
"sorry about the tag clouds.")[7]
A second generation of software development discovered a wider 
diversity of uses for tag clouds as a basic visualization method
for text data. Several extensions of tag clouds have been proposed 
in this context.
